# The Don't Fret Guitar Pedal Recommender

A guitar pedal recommender to help make buying new pedals easier.

Guitar pedals are one of the many tools guitarists can use to adjust the sound of the music they play.
For guitarists looking to dive deeper into the realm of pedals, it can be a daunting task to decide which to purchase. There are various categories (distortion, delay, tuner, etc.) that each have hundreds of pedals to choose from. A great deal of these pedals can also be better for specific genres and/or playing styles. As such, a great deal of research can go into purchasing just one pedal. This recommender attempts to help narrow down the search and help guitarists make the decision of what pedals to purchase.
